# Smart-City-Mobility-Traffic-Flow-Optimisation
The goal of this data-driven analysis of urban mobility patterns is to increase traffic efficiency across developing metropolitan areas. The project's main goals are to model travel behavior, identify congestion hotspots, comprehend peak-hour flow dynamics, and provide city planners with visual solutions for decongestion and mobility optimization.
